Task-Description: Minimal Ubuntu server

 * feature: no-follow-recommends

This seed is approximately the smallest set of packages that could be
called "an Ubuntu server".

== Packages needed for the system to operate ==

 * apparmor
 * apport
 * apt
 * cloud-init
 * dbus
 * flash-kernel [riscv64]  # DTB upgrades when booting via grub
 * (needrestart)
 * netbase
 * pollinate
 * s390-tools [s390x]
 * snapd
 * sudo
 * systemd
 * systemd-sysv
 * udev
 * (unattended-upgrades)
 * ubuntu-release-upgrader-core

== Block device / filesystem tools ==

Some of these could be installed only when needed. But for now we just
always include all of them.

 * bcache-tools
 * btrfs-progs
 * cryptsetup
 * e2fstools
 * lvm2
 * mdadm
 * multipath-tools
 * ntfs-3g
 * open-iscsi
 * xfsprogs

== Other ==

ubuntu-drivers is installed in the server-minimal seed because the
environment that the installer runs in does not have apt configured
the same way as the installed system (or, more pedantically, the
filesystem tree that will be copied to the installed system), so it
essentially runs "chroot /target ubuntu-drivers install --gpgpu" or
similar. It's also not useless to have installed in the target system:
the user can add hardware later and install drivers then.

 * ubuntu-drivers-common

 * ubuntu-server-minimal
